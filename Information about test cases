NOTE: for testing :
	1) Remove any directory if present in project folder.
	2) Extract "QuestionBank.tar.gz", "Quiz.tar.gz" and "Info.tar.gz".<==These contain files for testing.
	3) bash test_cases command on terminal

===========================================================================================================================================
The "test_cases" file conains various test cases for testing the program. Some files and folder submitted are necessary for testing, like "moodle4.xml", "Question Bank.tar.gz" folder, etc.
The test cases are divided into sets, which are separated by blank line:

Set 1: compiles and shows help option

Set 2: Positive test cases.

Set 3: options without parameters

Set 4: Negative test cases

Set 5: options with multiple parameter and wrong parameter handling

Set 6: Multiple options at same time and with some extra parameters

Set 7: quizzy in interactive mode.

Set 8: Deletes all created folders, question, quiz, etc. and recompiles the project.

Set 9: Again runs the options, but this time not a single question bank, quiz is available.
